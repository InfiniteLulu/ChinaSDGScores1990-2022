# ChinaSDGScores1990-2022
# Description
The SDG score plays an important role in measuring sustainable development, especially in analyzing spatiotemporal variability. However, the complex relationships between SDG goals and data latency result in existing scores spanning narrow time periods, covering limited spatial areas, and using a limited number of indicators. To address this gap, we employ a machine-learning-based approach combined with Bayesian optimization to construct a dataset of sustainable development indices for 300 prefecture-level cities in China from 1990 to 2022. The standardized dataset is stored in the "score" directory, where each SDG-specific data file follows a consistent naming convention: "score\_*.xlsx" (where "*" denotes the SDG number, e.g., "score\_8.xlsx" for SDG 8). Each data file contains four key variables: (1) administrative division codes, (2) prefecture-level city names, (3) annual SDG scores. This dataset contributes to a better understanding of the progress of prefecture-level SDG goals.The dataset is open for use in scientific work and in public science outreach, as long as proper citation is given in related studies.
